## About me

Hi, my name is Kristian Muller, I have been born and raised in Australia with Irish and Swedish heritage. My education to date has been basic having only completed my SACE as well as a certificate 3 in sports and recreation. Something interesting about myself is that I’m a very tall standing at two hundred centre metres. My favourite hobby is playing football on the weekends and going to the driving range to smack a couple of golf balls.



# Interest in IT

## What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).

My interest in IT is in different software and hardware that can make the supply chian easier for firms to manage. I have always had an interest in IT but recently have had a specific interest in different software to make the supply chain management easier for firms like  WIMS, WMS or JAIX. This new interest has come about since the warehouse I wok in part time has moved from using paper-based inventory control to paperless RF scanners. I haven’t had much experience in IT apart from using the basics in the Microsoft suite and starting to learn how to use RF scanners at work to control inventory. However I am interested in broadening my knowledge in the area.

# Why did you choose to come to RMIT?

I chose to come to RMIT as it was the only university at the time that offered an online logistics degree. This was appealing to me as I’m now able to  juggle working part time and studying full time.

# What do you expect to learn during your studies?
During this semester in introduction to information technology I expect to learn the foundations of information technology and information about  new contemporary soft and hardware.
